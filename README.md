## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, Iâ€™m Kenny.
I build cool things, break stuff occasionally, and somehow make it work again.

Currently coding in React, mostly for Web Dev, AI, and ML, plus whatever seems interesting at 2 AM. Powered by caffeine, long motorcycle rides, and an endless obsession with tweaking UIs.

By day, Iâ€™m at Manipal University Jaipur. By night, probably debugging something that shouldâ€™ve worked.

Want to reach me? khaneesh50@gmail.com.
